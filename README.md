# Twitter-like web service

This is a twitter-like web service, where users can tweet, like tweets, and search certain words in timeline. They can also see profile page of each user.
I did this project in one of the classes that I took in a US university during an exchange program. Practiced to interface frontend, backend, and database file. Also wrote APIDOC.
